    "text": "TPI stands for Target Population Index. It is a tool developed to be used in several scientific disciplines to evaluate how particular segments (subgroups) of a population fare compared with the rest of the population. We refer to the subgroup of interest as the target population, that is the target of future policies for instance, hence the index’s name.\nA theoretical worst-case and a theoretical best-case situation are used as two distinct population-specific benchmarks, to determine the relative position of the subgroup of interest in relation to the rest of the population. This allows to characterise the situation of specific subgroups and compare them one to another, or to assess the same subgroup in different positions in time.\nPlease refer to the paper of Pritchard et al.1 for more details about the methodology and the theoretical framework that underlines the TPI concept.\nIn the paper we discuss also an application of the index to transport studies, using 49 of the largest US metropolitan regions as a case study.  In particular, the variable job accessibility by public transport is assessed for two population subgroups that are especially likely to benefit from public transport: adults without a car and adults living in poverty.  The analysis finds that the car-less population is comparatively better served by public transport than the poor population. Additionally, regions with a higher TPI score for car-less populations also tend to have public transport systems that better serve their population living in poverty. These results highlight that the proposed index allows for easy comparison across regions, despite large differences in the scale of the variable of interest (accessibility by public transport), the total population, and the size of the target groups (car-less or adults in poverty)."
