**TPI** stands for *Target Population Index*. It is a tool developed to be used in several scientific disciplines to evaluate how a particular segment of a population (the *target group*) fare, compared with the rest of the population in terms of selected variables of interest.

For instance in this project we show an application of TPI to measure transport justice in several US metropolitan areas, and we do so by analysing job accessibility (*variable of interest*) and assessing as subgroups "people without a car" and "people in poverty" (*target population*).
